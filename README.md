# Synotrain

This program is a **synonym trainer** - similar to generic vocabulary trainers but
specialized for learning groups of synonyms.

## Project Idea

This is the basic idea of this program:

- Manage synonym groups via data files which allow to learn any synonyms the user likes.
- Score System - Tracking progress can be fun - a bit of gamification may support the learning motivation
- Maybe some AI? - LLMs are good with language - using them instead / in addition to predefined synonym groups may be interesting.
